# Survey-of-ChatGPT
This project was for a class called Social Issues, Ethics and Professionalism.
We created a Google forms asking questions about the useage of ChatGPT in Academia.
The report generated can be found in the .docx format which encapsulates our findings.

To run the program:
1. download all of the .xlsx  files and the .py files into a folder except the Forms response file, which is all the responses gathered in Excel from Google forms. Run the .py files to find the tables and graphs created from the data gathered from our Google forms
